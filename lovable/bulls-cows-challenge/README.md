## How to Play

**Bulls & Cows** is a classic code-breaking game. Try to guess the secret 3-digit number in as few attempts as possible!

### Rules
- The secret number has 3 unique digits (0-9).
- Enter your guess using the number pad.
- After each guess, you’ll get feedback:
  - 🐂 **Bull**: A correct digit in the correct position.
  - 🐄 **Cow**: A correct digit in the wrong position.
- Use the feedback to deduce the secret number.
- You have a limited number of attempts to solve it.

### Example
- Secret: 427
- Your guess: 123
- Feedback: 1 Bull (2 is correct and in the right place), 1 Cow (4 is correct but in the wrong place)

### Tips
- Digits do not repeat.
- Use logic and process of elimination.
- Track your previous guesses and feedback.

Good luck and have fun cracking the code!
