Recent MS in Business Analytics Graduate | ~4 Years of FinTech Experience | Interest in "Sr. Consultant/Business Analyst" role – Job ID: R0000426965 @ PharmaACE

Dear Priyanka,

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to express my interest in the "Sr. Consultant/Business Analyst" (Job ID: R0000426965) role at PharmaACE.

I recently completed my MS in Business Analytics from the University of Washington's Foster School of Business (Class of 2025) in Seattle, Washington. Prior to my master’s, I spent nearly 4 years in fintech, working on large-scale, production-grade systems used by global financial institutions. My background spans Java, SQL, and Python, with a strong focus on analytics engineering, data quality, and translating complex systems into actionable insights for business, technology, and operational stakeholders.

If you’re open to it, I’d greatly appreciate any guidance you may have on the application process, and whether you’d be willing to review or share my resume with the appropriate team. Any insight from your experience would mean a lot.

Thank you for your time, and I really appreciate you considering my message.

Warm Regards,
Hrishikesh Rathod
